## Technologies used
**Frontend**
- I use [Hugo CMS](https://gohugo.io/) because it's fantastic for a website with basic needs (a couple of pages, displaying images, editing content), blazing fast, and very customizable
- Built a custom template
- SASS for CSS Preprocessing 
- Bootstrap for its grid system, and tons of CSS helpers
- A LOT of custom CSS because it's fun ❤️
- JavaScript for interactions and visual effects

**Backend**
- Node.js environment
- A good pair of scissors to build the grapes? 😁
